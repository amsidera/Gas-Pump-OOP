The goal of this project is to design two GasPump components using the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) covered in the course. I design an executable metamodel, referred to as MDA-EFSM, for GasPump components. This MDA-EFSM capture the “generic behavior” of both GasPump components and is de-coupled from data and implementation details. In my design, I use the following OO design patterns:
	- state pattern
	- strategy pattern
	- abstract factory pattern

This project has the following deliverables:
	- Project executable: projectCS586.jar
	- Project source code: CS586.rar

Execution Instructions:

To execute project.jar executable run in the terminal the following command:
	- java -jar projectCS586.jar

Note: It is necessary to have installed Java Runtime Environment.
